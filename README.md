# Animal Crossing Save Editor for Mac

Make your island feel more like you. Edit your Animal Crossing: New Horizons save on your Mac: find items for your pockets and home storage, adjust Bells and Nook Miles, customize your residents, and rearrange your island map.

Browse an example island to explore the app, or open your own exported save folder. Review your changes before saving, with automatic backups and restore tools to help you keep your original island.

Built for Mac, with a familiar interface and no extra software to install.

Current Mac version: **2.0**. Requires **macOS 14 or later**. Universal builds support Apple silicon and Intel. Supported save revisions: **ACNH 3.0.0–3.0.3**.

**First launch:** this build is ad-hoc signed and has not been notarized by Apple. If macOS blocks it and you trust this download, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** after attempting to launch it. See [Apple's first-launch instructions](https://support.apple.com/102445). A launch without this approval requires Developer ID signing and notarization, which are not yet available for this project.

## New in 2.0

- Centered, continuous pinch zoom from 100% to 500%, with five slider presets and sharp artwork at high zoom.
- Arrow-key tile selection without scrolling the map; item-only copy, paste, delete, and undo with complete object footprints.
- Default-on **Snap to tiles** beside zoom, with an information popover and on-screen keyboard guidance.

## What can you change?

- Player settings: primary resident name and birthday.
- Island settings: island name, hemisphere, airport, weather, fruit, and flowers.
- Pockets and home storage with bundled item icons, item search, quantities, and multiple-slot placement. Shift-click selects a range; Command-click adds or removes individual slots.
- Island map editing with NHSE object artwork, distinct building icons and size guides, continuous centered pinch zoom, keyboard navigation, and item copy/paste/delete.
- Animal-villager identities, personality, catchphrases, moving-out state, and basic friendship.
- Money editing, saved pocket loadouts, undo/redo, change review, full-save exports, verified backups, and restore.

## Before you start

You need an exported Animal Crossing: New Horizons save folder. This app edits that folder; you will need a separate way to export your save and import it back into your game.

Editing currently supports the primary player. Some features, including house interiors, DIY recipes, and custom designs, are not available yet. See the detailed comparison below for the full list.

Keep a separate copy of your original save and close the game before importing changes. Importing an edited save back into the game has not yet been tested for this release.

Checked on **29 October 2026** against NHSE revision [`cb07454`](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE/tree/cb0745415945776f73375bf0a434a8babf059307), including its [main editor](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE/blob/cb0745415945776f73375bf0a434a8babf059307/NHSE.WinForms/Editor.cs), [map editor](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE/blob/cb0745415945776f73375bf0a434a8babf059307/NHSE.WinForms/Subforms/Map/FieldItemEditor.cs), [inventory editor](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE/blob/cb0745415945776f73375bf0a434a8babf059307/NHSE.WinForms/Subforms/PlayerItemEditor.cs), and [villager editor](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE/blob/cb0745415945776f73375bf0a434a8babf059307/NHSE.WinForms/Controls/VillagerEditor.cs). Mac details are documented in the [Mac guide](ACNH-Save-Editor/macOS/README.md).

This is a partial NHSE port. Read the [Mac guide](ACNH-Save-Editor/macOS/README.md) for supported settings and limitations. Edits target the primary resident; unlocked inventory capacity and locked records are preserved.

## Build and test

The Mac app uses Swift Package Manager and Xcode's Swift toolchain. No third-party runtime is required.

```sh
cd ACNH-Save-Editor/macOS
swift test --scratch-path /private/tmp/NHSE-Mac-Tests --disable-sandbox
ACNH_BUILD_SCRATCH=/private/tmp/NHSE-Mac-Build ACNH_BUILD_OUTPUT=/private/tmp/NHSE-Mac-App ./scripts/build-app.sh
open "/private/tmp/NHSE-Mac-App/ACNH Save Editor.app"
```

Using a local build folder avoids file-provider metadata interfering with app signing in cloud-synced workspaces. Builds are ad-hoc signed, not notarized.

## Save files and validation

Open a complete exported save folder containing `main.dat`, `mainHeader.dat`, and the resident files. Review your draft, then export an edited copy or save with an automatic backup. Keep a separate original backup and import saves with the game closed.

**80 automated tests passed** for version 2.0, alongside native interface and independent export checks. See the [validation report](ACNH-Save-Editor/macOS/VALIDATION.md). Importing the edited save back into the game remains untested.

Personal save files, build caches, and packaged application bundles are excluded from this repository, except for the owner-contributed Yolo save included as the default example island.
